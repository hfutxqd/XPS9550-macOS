# macOS High Sierra (10.13.2) on the Dell XPS 15 (9550)
This repository contains **my own files** on the installation and configuration of macOS High Sierra (10.13.2) on the Dell XPS 15 (9550)

* Thanks darkhandz for [his High Sierrra guide](https://github.com/darkhandz/XPS15-9550-High-Sierra). Please read darkhandz's guide before you use my files.
* Use `MacBookPro13,3` SMBIOS, much thanks for @syscl.
  * Note that you need to modify `AppleGraphicsDevicePolicy.kext` to make external monitors work.
  * The model identifier is also correct now.
  * I hide my serial number as `C02*****GTFN`, you may generate it by your own.
* `Caps` and `Left-Ctrl` is exchanged in `VoodoooPS2`, you can modify it if you don't like this keyboard layout.

## Structure
* `CLOVER`: Clover EFI folder.
* `Kexts`: Kexts which should be installed in `S/L/E` or `L/E`.

## My laptop
**Dell XPS 9550**

* i7-6700HQ/HM170
* Nvidia GTX960M / HD530
* 3840x2160 (4K)
* DDR4 2133 16G (8G x 2)
* Dell wireless 1830 (BCM43602 + BCM20703A1 )
* 512GB NVMe SSD (Samsung PM951)

## Status

**Working**

* 98% of the system

**Not working**

* TB3/type-C port hot-plug maybe work.
    * I find that my TB3-DP adapter can hot-plug and the 4K external monitor works fine. Need more test.
    * My Nexus 6P is broken so I can't test.
* SD card reader (waiting for good news from [this post](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/321080-sineteks-driver-for-realtek-rtsx-sdhc-card-readers))

## Tips

To make external monitor works (if you use `iMac17,1` SMBIOS), you should do following steps:

1. Open `/System/Library/Extensions/AppleGraphicsControl.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleGraphicsDevicePolicy.kext/Contents/Info.plist`.
2. Find the Borad-ID which used in your config.plist such as "Mac-B809C3757DA9BB8D" or "Mac-65CE76090165799A" or "Mac-DB15BD556843C820".
3. Replace the attribute `Config2` with `none`
4. Execute commands `sudo kextcache -system-prelinked-kernel` and `sudo kextcache -system-caches`.
5. Reboot and everything is done.
